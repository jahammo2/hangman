# hangman

Class assignment from week 2:

Create a hangman game.

There is an array in js/hangman-words.js which contains 100 common English words.

The array's name is hangmanWords.

Your game should filter out any 1 and 2 letter words.

Your game should choose a word at random.

The user will then guess a letter.

The user has 8 guesses.

If the user guesses a letter correctly, you should update the screen accordingly.

If the user guesses incorrectly, you should decrement the users' number of guesses remaining.

If the user gets all the letters in the words before running out of turns, he/she wins.
